Machine Learning - Text Summarization Using Python

Text summarization are classified in two main categories-

1. Extractive Text Summarization and
2. Abstructive Text Summarization

There are many techniques available to generate extractive summarization. To keep it simple, I have used an unsupervised learning approach to find the sentences similarity and rank them. One benefit of this will be, we donâ€™t need to train and build a model prior start using it for your project.
