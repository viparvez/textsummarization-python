Abstructive Text Summarization using Amazon Food Review Dataset

The objective of this project is to build a model that can create relevant summaries for reviews written about fine foods sold on Amazon. This dataset contains above 500,000 reviews, and is hosted on Kaggle.

To build our model Jaemin Cho's tutorial for seq2seq was really helpful to get the code in working order because this is my first project. The architecture for this model is similar to Xin Pan's and Peter Liu's, here's their GitHub page.

The sections of this project are:

Inspecting the Data
Preparing the Data
Building the Model
Training the Model
Inferring Summaries
